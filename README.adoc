This is an incubating subproject of
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html[Apache Log4j]
to provide next-generation logging bridges between the
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/api.html[Log4j API]
and
https://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J].

For an overview of the **currently available** logging bridges, see
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/installation.html#impl[Installing a logging implementation].
